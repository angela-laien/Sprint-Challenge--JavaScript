2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

3. What is closure?
    A closure gives a inner function access to an outer enclosing function's scope.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
    1) When the 'new' keyword is used to call the function, 'this' inside the function is a brand new object.

    2) During explicit binding, 'apply', 'call', or 'bind' are used to call a function, and 'this' inside the function is the object that is passed in as the argument.

    3) During implicit binding, 'this' means the object on which the function is called 
    
    4) The 'this' keyword is the global object. With arrow functions, 'this' keeps the same value as its parent scope.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
    The super() is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.
